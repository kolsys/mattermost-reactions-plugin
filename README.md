# Mattermost Reactions Notifier plugin

This plugin extends Mattermost's functionality by providing real-time notifications whenever a user reacts to your messages. Just like Slack's Reactions feature, you'll be instantly alerted when someone adds a reactions to your posts.

## Key Features:

 **Customizable Notifications:** Set delay after a previous notification
 
 **Direct Messages:** Receive notifications for reactions in both public and private channels.
 
 **Thread Support:** Stay updated on reactions within threaded discussions.
 
 **Mobile Compatibility:** Enjoy seamless notifications on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Benefits:

 **Increased Engagement:** Stay connected with your team and foster a more interactive communication environment.
 
 **Improved Collaboration:** Quickly respond to feedback and acknowledge contributions.
 
 **Enhanced Visibility:** Never miss an important reaction to your messages.
 

By integrating this plugin into your Mattermost instance, you can significantly enhance your team's communication and collaboration.

## Usage

To completely turn off notifications you can use `/reactions` command.

## Development

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options. In order for the below options to work, you must first enable plugin uploads via your config.json or API and restart Mattermost.

```json
    "PluginSettings" : {
        ...
        "EnableUploads" : true
    }
```

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```json
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    },
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:
```
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:
```bash
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a webapp, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:
```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:
```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

### Releasing new versions

The version of a plugin is determined at compile time, automatically populating a `version` field in the [plugin manifest](plugin.json):
* If the current commit matches a tag, the version will match after stripping any leading `v`, e.g. `1.3.1`.
* Otherwise, the version will combine the nearest tag with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, e.g. `1.3.1+d06e53e1`.
* If there is no version tag, an empty version will be combined with the short hash, e.g. `0.0.0+76081421`.

To disable this behaviour, manually populate and maintain the `version` field.
